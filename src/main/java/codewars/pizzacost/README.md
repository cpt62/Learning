Kate and Michael want to buy a pizza and share it. Depending on the price of the pizza, they are going to divide the costs:

If the pizza is less than ‚Ç¨5,- Michael invites Kate, so Michael pays the full price.
Otherwise Kate will contribute 1/3 of the price, but no more than ‚Ç¨10 (she's broke :-) and Michael pays the rest.
How much is Michael going to pay? Calculate the amount with two decimals, if necessary.
